# Send-email
Python script that will allow you to automatically send an email via Gmail (+ multiple recipients).
You just have to input your gmail username and password as a sender and you have to change the receiver_list.txt to any gmail address that you want to send a message to.
You can explore the script so that it can send a message with html or attachment.
Happy exploring!
